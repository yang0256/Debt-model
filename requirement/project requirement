Description: This project requires you to formulate a hypothesis or problem statement, then work with real, public data publicly available data to train a ML model of your choice, produce results and analyze them – including lessons learned. You are to also repeat the process in MS Power BI to demonstrate the similarity and differences from a Python-based approach vs a data democratization enabling tool. You are to work by yourself or in a team that does not exceed 3 people. 
Requirements: 
Team meeting: Meet with me to identify your team, your topic, and what you will have ready to show me in 1 week.
Deliverables:
